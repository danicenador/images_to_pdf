# JPG to PDF Converter

This project is a simple Python application that converts images in JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats into PDF files. The application processes images stored in subfolders of an `input` directory and generates corresponding PDF files in an `output` directory.

## Features

- Automatically detects subfolders in the `input` directory.
- Converts all images in each subfolder into a single PDF file, sorting by name.
- Saves the generated PDF files in the `output` directory with the name of the subfolder.
